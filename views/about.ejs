          I am building a speech activated drawing and design application that runs in the browser. This application will be built on the foundation of accessibility. The software will be designed for users who, due to congenital, disease or injury related disabilities, are unable to use traditional digital hardware like a mouse and keyboard. Users who do not have the time or ability to master complex software like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator will also benefit from the simplicity of this application. By removing the human dependencies present in current visual creation software, I am able to build my application with just one human requirement: speech. By using simple phrases to illustrate shapes, colors and lines, users will be able to take the intuitive control of drawing with a pencil and combine it with the convenience of working digitally. A user can say, for example, “red square” to place a red square at a point on an XY chart.

          The ability to visually represent objects and ideas has always been a valuable skill, both personally and professionally. Increasingly, visual representation is done using digital tools available via the internet. It is natural to assume that internet technology creates new opportunities and methods for disabled people to engage with society professionally and personally. However, there is ongoing discussion between advocacy organizations and technology developers as to whether the Internet and related technologies foster inclusivity or actually further isolate disabled individuals from society (internetsociety.org) It is estimated that 15% of the world's population has a disability, yet research indicates that disabled people are far less engaged with the internet than the rest of the population (worldbank.org). The reality is that the cost, lack of training, aptitude and a steep learning curve required by most software precludes many people from participating in digital art creation. At the present time, digital creation software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator is accessible only to individuals who can manipulate a mouse and keyboard, and can either afford specialized training in the use of a very complicated software or are computer fluent enough to teach themselves using manuals or online tutorials. Those with limited use of their hands or cognitive difficulties would find it nearly impossible to enter a 6 digit code in Adobe Photoshop to select a color from a hex chart. Although organizations do attempt to provide adaptive techniques designed to increase access to internet technologies, these adaptations are often cumbersome and serve to further divide the disabled user from the rest of the population. A stylus held in one's teeth, for example, may indeed enable someone with limited use of their hands to draw, but it is not an elegant or inclusive solution. In my experiences working as a software engineering intern, I realized that adaptations to increase accessibility are treated as an afterthought; first, build the product and then develop the assistive technology. I believe that the next generation of software should reflect our ability to make technology that truly is accessible for any user: empathy, accessibility and inclusion should be pillars of software development. I plan to do this by a developing software program that is built to be accessible by disabled individuals from the beginning. My project will result in voice-activated technology that will enable those with limited use of their hands to draw. A future version could allow users to use voice to create charts and graphs, a technology which could increase job opportunities for those with limited digital mobility. The added benefit of this approach is that this software should be equally appealing and appropriate for people without disabilities; it has the potential to make drawing and graphing software accessible to people who do not have specialized training in design.

        There have been significant advances in voice activated research and products; for example, Siri, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home, but these technologies seem to be focused on enabling the user to use voice commands to obtain information or to control devices. I am quite expert in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, dedicated visual drawing software, but I have not found any voice-activated version of these products in the marketplace, nor have I been able to find technical reports of this type of development. Figma, a startup in San Francisco has built a multi-user version of Photoshop in the browser, however, like Adobe’s software, it requires a huge amount of time to master. Google’s Project Magenta is using machine learning to create new forms of art and music. IBM has built Watson, a supercomputer for artificial intelligence, to develop the most sophisticated speech recognition software currently available for developers. None of these programs are designed for inclusivity. My project is unique because it combines voice technology and digital creation and brings the sophisticated engineering down to understandable user application. Creating accessible software is complicated because people with different types of disabilities require different accommodations. For example, this software will not work for a color blind user or someone who cannot speak. However, not developing an application out of the concern that it will not impact enough people is not the right approach to bridging the gaps that currently exist in our internet. This is why research will be so important in the development of this application, as it will help me make a product that is extremely effective and will meet the needs of the largest user base possible.
